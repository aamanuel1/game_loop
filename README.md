# game_loop
Udemy coursework for creating a game loop with C and SDL that I got one day.
The course is called "Create a Game Loop using C and SDL, free at udemy at https://www.udemy.com/course/game-loop-c-sdl/.

The source code was compiled with gcc on Ubuntu 22.04.1 on WSL2 with SDL2 as a dependency to practice using linux and bash and making makefiles. The project can also be compiled for Windows but the source code needs to be changed accordingly. Easiest way is to use Visual Studio and SDL for VS. Work ongoing to improve it, time permitting.
